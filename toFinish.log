Hayush!

Some things still don't work:
1. EOF doesn't stop the getchar thing
2. didn't manage to test the convert functions cause I was trying to understand the EOF error
3. the code compiles with the string >> gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors main.c -o ex1
   (It's in the Assignment document, I just ran it in the command line)
4. What's left to do is basically fixing the EOF and testing the rest of the program, there are probably some bugs
5. I was wrong about puting the null in the dict arrays, it's probably true just in c++
6. I'll explain to you the changes I made when we meet again, but I basically just googled the errors

Have fun!! xoxo
